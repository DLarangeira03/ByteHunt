# 🔍 ByteHunt

**ByteHunt** is an interactive platform that allows users to explore and compare tech products side by side. With a clean and responsive design, it helps users make informed decisions by automatically highlighting the best and worst attributes of each item. 

Registered users can also suggest new products to be added to the catalog, while moderators and administrators manage the platform through powerful tools and access levels. ByteHunt also includes a secure public REST API with JWT authentication and full Swagger documentation.

> 🎓 This project was developed as the final assignment for the **Web Development** course at **Instituto Politécnico de Tomar (IPT)** during the 2024/2025 academic year.
